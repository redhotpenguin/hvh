Spending too much time in spreadsheets?  Does your calculator work overtime figuring out your finances.  Do you pay a bookkeeper to translate credit card receipts into Quickbooks?  Rewriting the same rental agreement over and over?  Not getting the internet exposure you need?

Don't waste time.  Time is precious and should be spent having fun, loving life, and going on vacation!  Make more time for yourself by letting HVH handle your data.  Your focus should be bringing in revenue and offering great accommodations.  We'll take care of the back-end processing.
