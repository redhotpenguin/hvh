There are breathtaking ocean views from every room in the house. Hideaway Bay has been described as: \"a gorgeous home with great character and an essence of joy.\" (We think the Feng Shui is working).\n<br><br>\n\nThis fully equipped vacation home is surrounded by lush tropical plants, a large open grass yard, and an organic citrus orchard. Inspiring ocean views expand from every room out onto conservation-land bluffs protected for nesting albatross. The location of the property is ideal, benefiting from the proximity of the North Shore while receiving a much lower average annual rainfall than either Princeville or Hanalei.\n<br><br>\n\nSituated just 2 bays east of picturesque Kilauea Lighthouse, Hideaway Bay feels very remote but is just minutes from fine dining, the Princeville Resort, and the many natural wonders of the North Shore.Hideaway Bay is an immaculate executive home with warm Hawaiian style. The home is beautifully decorated in Hawaiian, Asian, and Jungle motifs. The great room, pictured here, was designed for comfort yet feels elegant and exotic. Asian-Pacific decor and architecture invite in beauty and peace from the outdoors.\n<br><br>\n\nRelax on the two earth toned sleeper sofas and search for whales out in the ocean, or watch satellite programming on the 36\" t.v. Stay in the jungle master with king size sleigh bed, two person lavender Jacuzzi whirlpool bathtub, extra large glass shower, and large walk-in closet. The Hawaiian master bedroom and full bath feel like an outdoor suite with three walls of windows and beautiful sunrise views. Hideaway Bay is surrounded by mountain and ocean views with a big open yard yet is still secluded from the outside world. Large windows throughout the house bring in warm natural light and reveal the beauty of the landscape in every direction. On clear days (usually the case) there is also a humbling view of Mount Na-molo-kama from the fully equipped gourmet kitchen. At the end of your day\'s adventures, settle into your luxurious hot tub with stunning ocean view. Hideaway Bay will enchant, relax, and delight you.
